This is my final project for CS50. It is an airfoil analysis tool.


INSTALLATION:

To use this code, you will need to download a few modules. First is matplotlib. If you do not have matplotlib, you can install it using

python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib

in the command line. Next is numpy. If you do not have numpy, you can install it using

pip install numpy
(https://numpy.org/install/)

in the command line. The code also uses the CS50 Python module. If you do not have it, you can install it using

pip3 install cs50
(https://github.com/cs50/python-cs50/blob/develop/README.md)

in the command line. The code also uses Flask. If you do not have it, you can still it using

pip install Flask
(https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/)

in the command line. Finally, the code uses a Python implementation of XFOIL. This can be installed using

pip install pip install xfoil
(https://pypi.org/project/xfoil/)

TESTING:

To test that you have installed all of these modules correctly, open your IDE and try importing them. For example, you can type the following:

import matplotlib
import numpy
import cs50
import flask
from xfoil import XFoil

If you are able to run this without error, it means you have installed the necessary modules correctly.
